Installation
============

Currently, bsparse is not on PyPI. It can thus only be installed
directly from the Git repository. This is as easy as

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install git+https://github.com/vetschn/bsparse


The only dependencies are NumPy
(facilitating the underlying data structures) and SciPy (for conversion
purposes only).
